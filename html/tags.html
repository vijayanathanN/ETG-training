<h2> Cricket</h2>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven
 players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
 pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
 balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on 
 the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) 
 the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at 
 the other end. The batting side's players score runs by 
 striking the bowled ball with a bat and running between 
 the wickets, while the bowling side tries to prevent this
 by keeping the ball within the field and getting it to either
 wicket, and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of
 dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps
 and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching.</P>

 Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, typically 
 of nine players each, that take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds
